1. Create the Header component
  - will consist of just an h2 imported inside App.js  

2. Balance Component
  - Create a seperate div, under the Header but inside the entire div... 
    - assigned container as className
  - Pass the Balance component inside div. 
  - Create the Balance Component and import inside App.js
  ** I DID NOT ADD IT AS A FUNCTIONAL COMPONENT TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN **

3. The income-expense component

4. The Transaction
  - Will consist of two components: A TransactionList Component and an individual Transaction Component
  - to begin, start by creating the transaction list... (TransactionList.js)

5. Add New Transaction component
  - create a new component "AddTransaction"

THE GLOBAL STATE:
1. Create a new folder, 'context'
2. inside this folder, create a file called "GlobalState.js". (will hold the context)
  A)  import React { createContext, useReducer } from 'react';
  B)  inialize our state, the global state; the global state will be an object and any data that needs to be shared throughout the app will need to be inside here.
      - In this case, we will only need to transactions 
          -- we will later call ACTIONS such as Add transaction, Delete transaction, etc.
